# SpMeta: Spatial Meta Analysis/Regression Modeling

This package implements a hierarchical Bayesian meta analysis/regression for areal spatial data and accounts for spatial correlation in the data in multiple ways. There is also the option for a more traditional non-spatial analysis. The method relies on the conditional autoregressive model and is fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Please see the "SpMeta_Model_Details" and "SpMeta_Example" folders for more specific information regarding the statistical model and package use details, respectively.
